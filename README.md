After you clone the repo from:

git clone https://github.com/PiwkaNorbert/CDU_Modpack.git
```
## Change the IP address of the backend 

Inside the root of the project, create a text file with the name `.env` (this is the full file name).

Add `VITE_NODE_ENV = "production"`


```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Constants.tsx/

```
Next change:
  - export const apiBase = isDev ? "https://www.trainjumper.com" : isProd ? "`to your desired IP address`" : "";


## ðŸ§žRun these Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project and run the following commands in this order from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |


This should generate a folder called `./dist/` and in this folder you will have all the content of the site.

Place the content of the `./dist/` folder into your `nginx` and it should work
